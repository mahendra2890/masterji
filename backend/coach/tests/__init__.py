"""Coach API tests. The two invariants that matter most:

1. Tenancy — foreign goals 404 (never 403; nothing to probe).
2. The gate — no phase advances without accepted proofs, whoever asks.

LLM calls are stubbed: tests assert the server's decisions, not the model's
prose. The stock-fallback path (LLM down → proof still accepted) is a
feature and is tested as such.
